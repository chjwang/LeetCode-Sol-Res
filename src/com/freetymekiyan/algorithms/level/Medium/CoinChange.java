     *
     * Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each
     * of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of
     * coins doesnâ€™t matter.

     For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}.
     So output should be 4. For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2},
     {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. So the output should be 5.

     1) Optimal Substructure

     To count total number solutions, we can divide all set solutions in two sets.
     1) Solutions that do not contain mth coin (or Sm).
     2) Solutions that contain at least one Sm.
     Let count(S[], m, n) be the function to count the number of solutions, then it can be written as
     sum of count(S[], m-1, n) and count(S[], m, n-Sm).

     Therefore, the problem has optimal substructure property as the problem can be solved using
     solutions to subproblems.

     2) Overlapping Subproblems
     Following is a simple recursive implementation of the Coin Change problem. The implementation
     simply follows the recursive structure mentioned above.

     C() --> count()
          C({1,2,3}, 5)
      /                 \
     /                   \
     C({1,2,3}, 2)                 C({1,2}, 5)
     /       \                        /         \
     /        \                     /           \
     C({1,2,3}, -1)  C({1,2}, 2)        C({1,2}, 3)    C({1}, 5)
     /     \            /    \            /     \
     /        \          /      \          /       \
     C({1,2},0)  C({1},2)   C({1,2},1) C({1},3)    C({1}, 4)  C({}, 5)
     / \      / \       / \        /     \
     /   \    /   \     /   \      /       \
     .      .  .     .   .     .   C({1}, 3) C({}, 4)
     /  \
     /    \
     .      .

     It should be noted that the above function computes the same subproblems again and again.
     See the following recursion tree for S = {1, 2, 3} and n = 5.
     The function C({1}, 3) is called two times. If we draw the complete tree, then we can see that
     there are many subproblems being called more than once.

     Since same suproblems are called again, this problem has Overlapping Subprolems property.
     So the Coin Change problem has both properties (see this and this) of a dynamic programming
     problem. Like other typical Dynamic Programming(DP) problems, recomputations of same subproblems
     can be avoided by constructing a temporary array table[][] in bottom up manner.

     f(n, k): number of ways of making change for n cents, using only the first k+1 types of coins.

     f(n, k) = 0, n < 0 || k < 0
     f(n, k) = 1, n == 0
     f(n, k) = f(n, k-1) + f(n-C[k], k), else
