/**
 * Convert a non-negative integer to its english words representation. Given input is guaranteed to be less than 2^31 -
 * 1.
 * <p>
 * For example,
 * 123 -> "One Hundred Twenty Three"
 * 12345 -> "Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"
 * 1234567 -> "One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"
 * Hint:
 * <p>
 * Did you see a pattern in dividing the number into chunk of words? For example, 123 and 123000.
 * Group the number by thousands (3 digits). You can write a helper function that takes a number less than 1000 and
 * convertPostfix2Infix just that chunk to words.
 * There are many edge cases. What are some good test cases? Does your code work with input such as 0? Or 1000010?
 * (middle chunk is zero and should not be printed out)
