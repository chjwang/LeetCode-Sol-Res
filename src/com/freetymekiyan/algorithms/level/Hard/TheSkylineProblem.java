/**
 * A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a
 * distance. Now suppose you are given the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo
 * (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings collectively (Figure B).
 * <p>
 * Figure A: https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/skyline1.jpg
 * Figure B: https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/skyline2.jpg
 * <p>
 * Buildings Skyline Contour
 * The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are
 * the x coordinates of the left and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It is
 * guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You may assume all buildings are perfect
 * rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.
 * <p>
 * For instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [ [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20
 * 10], [19 24 8] ] .
 * <p>
 * The output is a list of "key points" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of [ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ]
 * that uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last
 * key point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the termination of the skyline, and always has
 * zero height. Also, the ground in between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline
 * contour.
 * <p>
 * For instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3 15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8],
 * [24, 0] ].
 * <p>
 * Notes:
 * <p>
 * The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range [0, 10000].
 * The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x position Li.
 * The output list must be sorted by the x position.
 * There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...[2 3], [4 5],
 * [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final
 * output as such: [...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]

public class TheSkylineProblem {

    /**
     * Heap. Line Sweep Algorithm.
     * All possible key points are at the edges of rectangle.
     * Add all top-left and top-right corners to a list.
     * Set top-left's height to negative to indicate it's left and put them before right points.
     * Sort the points by x asc, y asc.
     * Create a tree map with 0,1 in it by default.
     * Track the height of previous added key point.
     * Then for each point p in the list:
     * | If p[1] < 0, left point:
     * |   Add the height count to tree map.
     * | If p[1] > 0, right point:
     * |   Reduce the height count to tree map. If count is 1, remove the height.
     * | Get the highest by map.firstKey().
     * | If the highest != previous height, a key point found:
     * |   Add it to result.
     * |   Update previous height to current height.
     * <p>
     * Tricks:
     * 1. Store left points height as negative, then they can be distinguished from right points.
     * 2. Put height 0 count 1 into tree map as a dummy rectangle. 0 is the max height when there is no rectangle.
