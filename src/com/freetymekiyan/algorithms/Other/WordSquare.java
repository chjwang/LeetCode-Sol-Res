/**
 * Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares you can build from them. A
 * sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string,
 * where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).
 *
 * For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square because each
 * word reads the same both horizontally and vertically. b a l l a r e a l e a d l a d y
 *
 * Note: There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words. All words will have the exact same length.
 * Word length is at least 1 and at most 5. Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.
 *
 * Example 1: Input: ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]
 * Output: [ [ "wall", "area", "lead", "lady" ], [ "ball", "area", "lead", "lady" ] ]
 * Explanation: The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just
 * the order of words in each word square matters).
 *
 * Example 2: Input: ["abat","baba","atan","atal"]
 * Output: [ [ "baba", "abat", "baba", "atan" ], [ "baba", "abat", "baba", "atal" ] ]
 * Explanation: The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just
 * the order of words in each word square matters).

    /**
     * My first approach is brute-force, try every possible word sequences, and use the solution of
     * Problem 422 (https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-word-square/) to check each sequence. This
     * solution is straightforward, but too slow (TLE).
     *
     * A better approach is to check the validity of the word square while we build it. Example:
     * ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"] We know that the sequence contains 4 words because the
     * length of each word is 4.
     *
     * Every word can be the first word of the sequence, let's take "wall" for example.
     *
     * Which word could be the second word? Must be a word start with "a" (therefore "area"),
     * because it has to match the second letter of word "wall".
     *
     * Which word could be the third word? Must be a word start with "le" (therefore "lead"),
     * because it has to match the third letter of word "wall" and the third letter of word "area".
     *
     * What about the last word? Must be a word start with "lad" (therefore "lady"). For the same
     * reason above.
     *
     * In order for this to work, we need to fast retrieve all the words with a given prefix. There
     * could be 2 ways doing this:
     * - Using a hashtable, key is prefix, value is a list of words with that prefix.
     * - Trie, we store a list of words with the prefix on each trie node.
     * The only difference between the trie here and the normal trie is that we hold one more list
     * of all the words which have the prefix(from the root char to the current node char).
